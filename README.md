# Restaurant page I made to improve my skill of using webpack and dynamic DOM.

### Traditional Latgalian culture did inspire me of making this web page theme.

<div align="center"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3b87c25-4bc5-4f69-b161-ec5a218cac1b" alt="screenshot of website" width="900" /></div>

This project was completed for The Odin Project Javascript Restaurant Page Assignment. The aim of the project was to make a functional multi page Restaurant website using WebPack to bundle files.

## Build with
- Vanilla JS
- HTML5
- CSS

##### Once you are on the Home Page, you have three links in the navbar
- **Home**.- To return to the Home Page.
- **About**.- About Us section, where to find us and form to book a table.
- **Menu**.- A small fraction of the Dishes and Drinks that we serve.
